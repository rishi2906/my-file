The purpose of Point-in-Time (PIT) and Through-the-Cycle (TTC) Probability of Default (PD) models is to assess credit risk under different perspectives. 
PIT PD models estimate the likelihood of default based on current economic conditions and borrower-specific information, providing a snapshot of credit risk 
that reflects real-time changes in the economic environment. In contrast, TTC PD models estimate the default probability by smoothing out the effects of economic 
cycles, focusing on the borrower's creditworthiness over an economic cycle's entirety. This helps in understanding the long-term average risk and mitigating 
procyclicality in credit risk assessment and capital requirements. Combining both models provides a more balanced and comprehensive view of credit risk, aligning 
short-term assessments with long-term risk management strategies.
