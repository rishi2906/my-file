Decision Strategy:

If the ADF test fails to reject the null hypothesis (suggesting non-stationarity) and the KPSS test rejects its null hypothesis (also suggesting non-stationarity), then the time series is likely non-stationary.
If the ADF test rejects the null hypothesis (suggesting stationarity) and the KPSS test fails to reject its null hypothesis (also suggesting stationarity), then the time series is likely stationary.
Mixed results indicate the need for further investigation, possibly through differencing or other transformations.
