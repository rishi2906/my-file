IFRS 9 mandates that financial institutions utilize a forward-looking approach to estimate and recognize expected credit losses (ECL) by incorporating the 
Probability of Default (PD). The PD model must estimate the likelihood of default over both the next 12 months and the entire lifetime of the financial asset, 
factoring in forward-looking information such as macroeconomic conditions. For ECL, institutions are required to calculate the present value of all cash shortfalls 
over the expected life of the financial asset, considering different possible outcomes and scenarios. The model must reflect unbiased and probability-weighted amounts 
determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, thus ensuring a comprehensive assessment of credit risk.
