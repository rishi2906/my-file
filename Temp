o refine the Probability of Default (PD) model for the Corporate and SME segments developed for IFRS 9 reporting, several strategies can be considered to enhance the accuracy, robustness, and forward-looking aspects of the model. Here are some key recommendations:

1. Data Quality and Enrichment
Increase Data Granularity: Since macroeconomic variables (MEVs) were interpolated from annual to quarterly frequency, this introduces a potential source of error. Where possible, seek to gather quarterly or monthly macroeconomic data to avoid interpolation, which could lead to loss of information or misrepresentation of trends. You might also explore alternative data sources that offer more granular data, such as industry-specific economic indicators or regional business activity metrics.
Use of Alternative Data: Supplement traditional financial data with alternative data sources such as transactional data, market sentiment, and sector-specific indicators to capture nuances, especially for SMEs where financial statements might not fully reflect creditworthiness.
Address Data Limitations for SMEs: If SME data remains limited, consider incorporating proxy variables or using external credit risk databases to fill gaps, or applying transfer learning from similar markets where data is richer.
2. Model Segmentation and Treatment
Segment Refinement: Currently, the model combines Corporate and SME data, which may mask important distinctions between these segments. Refine the segmentation further, potentially creating sub-segments (e.g., by industry or firm size) to capture heterogeneity more effectively.
Separate Models for Corporate and SME: Although separate regression models are used for forward-looking PiT PD, consider developing fully independent models for each segment, as the risk dynamics and economic sensitivity of large corporates versus SMEs can vary significantly.
Non-linear Modeling Techniques: Explore advanced modeling techniques such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Random Forests, or Neural Networks to capture non-linear relationships between macroeconomic factors and PD. These methods can help identify interactions between variables that linear models may miss, especially for complex economic environments.
3. Enhance Forward-Looking Capabilities
Macro-Financial Linkage Refinement: For converting Through-the-Cycle (TTC) PD to Point-in-Time (PiT) PD, improve the robustness of the forward-looking component by testing more advanced time-series techniques like Vector Autoregression (VAR) or Bayesian VAR, which can help in better capturing the relationship between PD and macroeconomic variables over time.
Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing: Expand the range of macroeconomic scenarios to capture a broader spectrum of potential outcomes, including adverse scenarios. Incorporating stress testing will ensure the model remains robust under different economic conditions, enhancing forward-looking accuracy.
Dynamic Model Calibration: As the model spans data from 2012 to 2023, calibrate it regularly to incorporate recent data and capture changes in economic conditions (e.g., post-COVID economic recovery, inflationary pressures). This can improve the predictive power of the forward-looking PiT PD.
4. Interpolation Method Improvement
Advanced Interpolation Techniques: The current use of simple interpolation for macroeconomic variables may not fully capture the volatility or trends present between annual data points. Consider using more sophisticated interpolation methods, such as cubic splines, or leveraging Kalman Filters or state-space models, which can provide more accurate quarterly estimates based on economic dynamics and historical patterns.
Macroeconomic Feature Engineering: Create derived variables from the macroeconomic data (e.g., moving averages, growth rates, or lagged variables) to better reflect trends and cyclical changes, enhancing the model’s responsiveness to economic shifts.
5. Model Validation and Monitoring
Backtesting and Benchmarking: Conduct rigorous backtesting of the model to ensure its predictive accuracy over time. This should include comparing model outputs to actual historical default rates and evaluating its performance against benchmarks (e.g., industry-standard PD models).
Ongoing Model Monitoring: Establish a robust monitoring framework to track the model's performance on an ongoing basis. Monitor key metrics such as calibration accuracy, predictive power (e.g., ROC-AUC, KS-statistic), and model drift to ensure the model adapts to evolving market conditions.
6. Regularizing Model Complexity
Prevent Overfitting: Given the potential for limited data, especially for SMEs, employ regularization techniques (such as L1/L2 regularization) to prevent overfitting, particularly when using more complex models. Cross-validation should also be rigorously applied to select optimal hyperparameters.
Incorporate Feature Selection: Apply advanced feature selection techniques like LASSO or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify the most critical variables and improve the interpretability of the model, especially for regulatory and stakeholder reporting.
7. Model Explainability and Fairness
Model Interpretability: Ensure the model remains interpretable, especially for regulatory purposes. Consider integrating explainability tools such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) or SHAP to make it easier to understand the impact of each feature on predictions and provide clearer justifications for decisions.
Fairness and Bias Detection: Perform fairness checks to ensure the model is not disproportionately affecting certain segments (e.g., small businesses or specific industries). Bias detection algorithms can help reveal any disparities in model predictions across different subpopulations.
By addressing these aspects—data granularity, model refinement, advanced methodologies, and regular validation—you can improve the robustness, accuracy, and compliance of the PD model in line with IFRS 9 standards and evolving economic conditions.
