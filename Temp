Hi Kevin,

Below is the Progress Update on TTC Models:

i.	Simba and Srijani gave feedback on the Banks/ FI and Sovereign TTC PD model. We are working on their comments and will share the updated document on Sunday.
ii.	We will re-run the TTC PD model for SME and Corporate using updated data (after GHO overriding using parent GHO) and share the results by Sunday EoD.
iii.	Next week, we will work on PIT model variable selection and model calibration. 

We are also able to log in to the two new laptops. However, we are still waiting on shared folder access for file sharing.

Have a great weekend!
