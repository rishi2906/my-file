Steps to Verify the Markov Property for a Transition Matrix:
Calculate Transition Probabilities: Obtain the transition matrix from the S&P ratings data. This matrix should represent the probabilities of moving from one rating to another over a specified period (e.g., one year).

Compute Higher-Order Transitions: Calculate the n-step transition matrices (e.g., 2-step, 3-step) by multiplying the 1-step transition matrix by itself n times.

Compare Empirical Transitions: Compare the n-step empirical transition probabilities (obtained directly from historical data) with the n-step transition probabilities derived from the 1-step transition matrix.

Perform Statistical Tests: Use chi-square tests or other statistical measures to compare the model-derived n-step matrices with empirical n-step matrices. If the differences are not statistically significant, the Markov property holds.
