For credit risk modeling, there are different methodologies used to derive Point-in-Time (PIT) and Through-The-Cycle (TTC) probabilities of default (PDs). Two common approaches are:

i. Two-Step Approach (Separate Derivation of TTC and PIT PDs)
In this approach, TTC PDs and PIT PDs are derived separately in a structured manner. This typically involves the following steps:

Derive TTC PDs: Calculate TTC PDs using long-term average default rates that smooth out economic cycles.
Adjust to PIT PDs: Adjust the TTC PDs to reflect current economic conditions, often using econometric models or macroeconomic variables.
ii. Black Box Approach (Direct PIT PD Curve without Intermediate TTC PD)
In this approach, a complex model directly generates PIT PDs without explicitly deriving or utilizing intermediate TTC PDs. This often involves machine learning or advanced statistical techniques where the inner workings of the model are not easily interpretable, hence the term "black box."

Summary
Two-Step Approach: This involves separately deriving TTC PDs using long-term averages and then adjusting them to reflect current economic conditions to obtain PIT PDs.
Black Box Approach: This uses advanced models (often machine learning) to directly produce PIT PDs without explicit intermediate TTC PDs, focusing on the final output.
These approaches provide flexibility in credit risk modeling, allowing financial institutions to choose methodologies based on their specific needs, available data, and regulatory requirements.
