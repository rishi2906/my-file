The team spent considerable time yesterday and today experimenting with various input data combinations to evaluate their impact on the ECL. Here are the key observations:
Segmentation Impact: The largest factor contributing to the reduction in ECL is segmentation. When we combined the SME and corporate segments and made some data 
adjustments, the ECL was similar to what is currently observed in production.
MRS Scale Effect: The second significant factor for the decrease in ECL is the MRS scale. Using the old MRS (previously applied in an earlier version of the model) 
results in an increase in ECL by approximately $150M. However, the source of the old MRS is currently unknown.
Further Testing: Tomorrow, we plan to test another combination similar to the first point, but this time using the data that we prepared and submitted to IMR. 
This will help us assess the impact of the data tweak on the ECL.
