We have finalized the TTC PD Model document for the Banks and FI Segment and are sharing it for your review. Please look into it and provide your feedback.

Note that this document includes sections/placeholders for the entire model (i.e., TTC, PIT, and Link function). However, we've only filled out the sections 
related to the TTC model and left the PIT and other sections blank. We will complete the remaining sections once the PIT model is finished.
