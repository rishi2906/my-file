The derivation of a transition matrix is a more reasonable approach for modeling Through-the-Cycle (TTC) PD when rating transitions are observed because it reflects the real-world behavior of credit ratings, which fluctuate over time based on changes in borrowersâ€™ creditworthiness. The transition matrix approach captures these migrations between credit rating states, providing a more dynamic and accurate estimate of default risk. In contrast, assuming a constant marginal PD ignores the possibility of rating changes, oversimplifying the modeling process and failing to account for shifts in credit quality, which are crucial for realistic risk assessment.
