Hi Kevin,

Trust you are doing well. 

I am sharing the detailed gap analysis report on the 3rd generation of IFRS 9 models. Could you please review it and provide feedback?

Also, I would like to highlight the macroeconomic variable interpolation, we have mentioned in the gap report:

We interpolated macroeconomic variables and benchmarked them using 13 variables available quarterly. However, this may not be sufficient, given that we have around 700 variables, but only 13 common variables are available from Oxford Economics (OE) at a quarterly frequency. So, this is the best we can do. 

 Can we check with OE regarding the availability of quarterly data, especially for the selected combination of MEVs for the SME and Corporate segments?
