OLS Model Intercept Interpretation
When the intercept in an OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression model is insignificant, it generally does not affect the validity of the model, especially when the focus is on the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. This is because the primary interest in most regression analyses lies in the coefficients of the independent variables, which explain how changes in these variables impact the dependent variable.
The intercept (often represented as β0) is the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are equal to zero. In many models, this represents the baseline level of the outcome variable.
Practical Implications:
The insignificance of the intercept may indicate that the baseline level of the outcome is not meaningfully different from zero, or it may suggest that the situation where all predictors are zero is not relevant or realistic in the current context.
Should we keep or remove the intercept?
•	Even if the intercept is not statistically significant, it often still plays a role in ensuring that the model's predictions are unbiased.
•	Typically, the intercept is included in the model to avoid bias. Removing it can force the regression line through the origin, which may not be appropriate unless there is a strong theoretical justification for doing so (e.g., the dependent variable should logically be zero when all predictors are zero).

The significance of the intercept does not generally impact the interpretation of the slope coefficients, which are often of greater interest in the analysis.

o	This resource mentions that while an insignificant intercept indicates that the expected value of the dependent variable may be close to zero when all predictors are zero, it does not invalidate the model. The key is that the inclusion of the intercept helps in fitting the model more accurately, even if it is not statistically significant.
