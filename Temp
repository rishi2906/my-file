Changes in macroeconomic conditions typically have a uniform effect on credit ratings in a PD (Probability of Default) model because such conditions, like economic downturns or interest rate hikes, affect a broad spectrum of borrowers simultaneously. These changes often lead to increased default probabilities across sectors, industries, or even entire economies, which are reflected in the PD model's inputs. As a result, the overall risk of default rises for many entities, causing a generalized downgrade in credit ratings. This uniformity arises from the systemic nature of macroeconomic shifts, which impact the creditworthiness of most borrowers, even if their individual circumstances remain unchanged.
