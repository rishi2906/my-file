Consumer spending in real local currency units (LCU) on household and garden tools and equipment and the default rate
Economic Health Indicator
•	Relevance: Consumer spending on household and garden tools and equipment is often considered a discretionary expenditure. Higher spending in this category can indicate consumer confidence and economic stability.
•	Impact on Default Rate: Increased spending on non-essential items like household and garden tools suggests that households have disposable income and are financially stable, potentially leading to lower default rates.

Consumer Confidence
•	Relevance: Spending on household and garden tools and equipment reflects consumer confidence in the economy. When consumers are confident, they are more likely to spend on such items.
•	Impact on Default Rate: High consumer confidence, indicated by increased spending, can lead to lower default rates as financially confident consumers are less likely to default on their obligations.
