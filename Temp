The Newey-West test, or more specifically, the Newey-West estimator, is crucial in regression analysis because it adjusts standard errors to account for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the residuals of an OLS model. 

Correcting for Autocorrelation and Heteroscedasticity
•	Autocorrelation: In time series data, observations are often correlated with their previous values, leading to autocorrelation in the residuals. This violates one of the key assumptions of OLS regression, which assumes that the residuals are independent. Autocorrelation can lead to underestimated standard errors and inflated t-statistics, making the coefficients appear more statistically significant than they are.
•	Heteroscedasticity: This occurs when the variance of the residuals is not constant across observations. Like autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity can distort the standard errors of the coefficients, leading to incorrect inferences.
The Newey-West estimator adjusts the standard errors to be robust to both autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity, ensuring more reliable statistical inference.
By providing more accurate standard errors, the Newey-West adjustment ensures that hypothesis tests (such as t-tests for individual coefficients or F-tests for overall model fit) are valid even in the presence of autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity. This makes the test particularly useful in time series econometrics, where these issues are common.
When residuals exhibit autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity, using unadjusted standard errors can lead to incorrect conclusions about the statistical significance of predictors. The Newey-West adjustment helps to prevent this by providing more accurate estimates, which in turn improves the model’s predictive accuracy.

To have a reliable significance test, model developers have computed Newey West standard error, which is valid even when the classical assumptions of homoskedasticity and no autocorrelation are violated. From the above table, it is clear that after estimating the robust standard error (using the Newey West estimator), there is no change in the coefficient magnitude, sign and significance with respect to the actual model (add reference to the actual model summary).  This shows that statistical inferences from the model are valid, and no autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity will impact the model prediction.
