The Vasicek framework, a foundational model in credit risk theory, is not always suitable for linking Point-in-Time (PIT) and Through-The-Cycle (TTC) 
probabilities of default (PDs) due to its underlying assumptions and focus. Here's a reference and a brief explanation:

Explanation
The Vasicek model, while effective for modeling credit risk and capital requirements, primarily assumes a static economic environment with mean-reverting default intensities. This makes it challenging to capture the dynamic nature of economic cycles and their impact on PDs.

Why Vasicek Framework is Not Suitable for Linking PIT and TTC PDs:
Static Nature: The Vasicek model assumes a static economic environment, which does not account for the changing nature of default probabilities over 
different economic cycles. PIT PDs fluctuate with current economic conditions, while TTC PDs are averaged over an economic cycle.

Mean Reversion: The model incorporates a mean-reverting process, which may not accurately capture the volatility and rapid changes in default probabilities 
observed in real-world economic cycles.

Systematic Risk Factors: The Vasicek framework focuses on systematic risk factors but may not adequately separate the idiosyncratic risk that affects PIT PDs
more directly than TTC PDs.

Empirical Limitations: Empirical studies, such as the one by Düllmann and Trapp (2004), highlight the model's limitations in capturing the full spectrum of 
risk dynamics, especially during periods of economic stress or recovery.

Detailed Argument:
To provide a robust framework for linking PIT and TTC PDs, models need to incorporate dynamic economic variables and conditions that can shift over time, 
reflecting the current state of the economy (PIT) and its long-term average behavior (TTC). Alternative models, such as those incorporating macroeconomic 
variables or stress-testing frameworks, are often preferred for this purpose.

In practice, financial institutions use a combination of models and empirical adjustments to bridge the gap between PIT and TTC PDs, acknowledging that no 
single model, including Vasicek's, can fully capture the complexities of economic cycles and their impact on credit risk.

For further reading, you might refer to literature on more advanced credit risk modeling approaches that account for time-varying economic conditions and 
provide a more nuanced link between PIT and TTC PDs.
