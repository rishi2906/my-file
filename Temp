The IFRS 9 Probability of Default (PD) model outputs the likelihood that a borrower will default on their obligations over a specified time horizon, 
incorporating forward-looking information and macroeconomic factors. This output is used to calculate Expected Credit Losses (ECL), which financial 
institutions must recognize to reflect potential credit losses accurately. The PD model ensures that credit risk assessments are dynamic and responsive 
to changing economic conditions, aiding in prudent risk management and regulatory compliance by aligning capital reserves with anticipated credit risks.
