Progress Update on TTC Models:

Banks/FI and Sovereign TTC PD Model:
Simba and Srijani provided feedback on this model. We are addressing their comments and will share the updated document by Sunday.

SME and Corporate TTC PD Model:
We will re-run the model using updated data (including GHO overrides with parent GHO) and share the results by Sunday end of day.

PIT Model:
Next week, we will focus on variable selection and model calibration for the PIT model.

Additionally, we have successfully logged in to the two new laptops. However, we are still awaiting access to the shared folder for file sharing.

Have a great weekend!
