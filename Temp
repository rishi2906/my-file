Cohort-Based Approach: The cohort approach is typically preferred by regulators for reporting purposes (e.g., Basel II/III, IFRS 9, CECL) due to its simplicity, transparency, and alignment with industry practices. It is easier for financial institutions to meet regulatory requirements using the cohort approach, and it is more straightforward for regulators to review, validate, and compare results across institutions.
