The figure illustrates the methodology for estimating lifetime Probability of Default (PD) under IFRS 9, comparing Unconditional Cumulative PD and Conditional 
Cumulative PD. The left chart shows Unconditional Cumulative PD, which reflects default probabilities without considering current economic conditions. 
The right chart presents Conditional Cumulative PD, which adjusts the Unconditional PD estimates by incorporating macroeconomic forecasts (e.g., oil prices, 
GDP growth rates) using a link function. This adjustment provides a more accurate and forward-looking assessment of credit risk over the lifetime of the financial 
asset, essential for calculating Expected Credit Losses (ECL) under IFRS 9.
