Unconditional marginal PD refers to the probability that a borrower will default in a specific time period, given that they have not defaulted up to the 
beginning of that period. It is "unconditional" because it does not depend on any particular conditions or scenarios; it is an average probability across all 
possible states of the world.

Cumulative PD, on the other hand, is the probability that a borrower will default at any time up to and including a specific time horizon. 
It accumulates the risk over multiple periods.
