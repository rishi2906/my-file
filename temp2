Reason for consumer spending: SMEs are more sensitive to business cycles (Rijken, 2005). They are expected to be more likely to fail, because they (1) are 
less likely to benefit from scale effects, (2) have less power in negotiations with financial and social partners, (3) are less likely to benefit from their
experience or ‘learning effects,’ compared to large firms, and (4) often operate in small markets, due to size effects. Because of the lack of product and market 
diversification and the fact that SMEs have in general a low(er) number of suppliers and consumers, SMEs face high uncertainty about their future cash flow levels 
and timing. This leads to volatile financial statement data through time (Rijken, 2005). The need to have financing available in order to seize unexpected market 
opportunities or to react to external shocks is particularly important for the vitality of SMEs (Rivaud-Danset, Dubocage and Salais, 1998). Flexibility is important 
because a company must be able to take advantage of customers’ needs and also because in their day-to-day activity SMEs meet uncertainty and need to react quickly to 
unexpected events or opportunities. A credit risk model should therefore be able to determine the PD within a short period of time.

For instance, when consumer demand declines, firm cash flow falls. Firms fail, even after shedding workers and/or closing temporarily, when they cannot cover the 
fall in cash flow due to financial constraints. Firm failure therefore arises from the interaction between negative non-financial shocks to liquidity and firm 
financial frictions because firms, even when financial markets function normally, cannot fully smooth these shocks by borrowing from the financial sector.
